            <h1>HOW IT ALL STARTED</h1>
            <p>
              I started climbing a few years ago. My friend Alfredo was into
              climbing and invited me to go to the rock gym with him. I wasn't
              very good but it was fun! I tried bouldering and top rope and
              found out that I was scared of heights. I met some new friends and
              fell in love with climbing.

            <p>
              I was still afraid of heights but kept pushing myself so that I
              could become a better climber. After some time I learned how to
              lead climb.

            <p>
              I was scared to climb outside because I didn't think I was good
              enough to not get hurt. But my same friends pushed me to go with
              them and i'm glad. It was so hard and made me rethink how good I
              thought I was. I was terrible but it was so much fun and
              completely different than climbing inside.

              At this point v3's and 4's were my normal and I was able to climb
              easier 5's and 6's. Understanding how to move and controlling your
              body is just as important if not more important than having
              muscles. Although being strong helps!
